Wordle is a virtual environment which will take a 'Target_Word' and a 'Next_Guess'. Greens, Yellows and greys should be defined as globals which are only appended to in the latter function, not overwritten. "

    "The methodology behind this approach is as follows: assuming all the words are equally likely to come up, the best next choice for a word is the word which reduces the number of other possible words that could come up after. Following this, I reason that we should chose a word which is most similar to all other words on the list. 'Similarity' is determined in terms of sharing common letters, and bonus points if they are in the same place. "
